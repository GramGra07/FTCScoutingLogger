I do not recommend using this version as it is outdated and not made well. If you want to though, here are the steps for installation
1. Make sure pip is installed on your computer, if not here are some
   instructions (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
2. Install PyQt6, run pip install PyQt6, this is the algorithm to make stuff appear
3. Install python3, instructions (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Clone this repository
5. Done
